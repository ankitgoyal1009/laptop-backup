Things I did for first time setup of my new laptop

install browser of your choice(firefox and brave in my case)
login to the browser account so all your passwords and bookmarks will sync
install any communication tool like slack
take backup of your old laptop, read the main file
install iTerm2
install ohMyZsh "https://ohmyz.sh/#install"
paste all your zsh_history, zshrc files etc.
install brew from https://brew.sh/
if you find "xcode-select: note: No developer tools were found, requesting install." error whiel cloning any repo or installing ohMyZsh, install xcode using `sudo xcode-select --install`
